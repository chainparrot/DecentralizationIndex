# DecentralizationIndex
Blockchains by Number of Nodes / Validators.

My notes from SoK: Blockchain Decentralization (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04256.pdf)

1. Protocol-based:
- Consensus & Network
- Governance
2. User-based:
- Wealth
- Transaction

1. Wallet user growth, 
2. Active address growth, 
3. Transaction count
4. Growth, and payment count growth are strongly associated with returns.

In light of the existing blockchain decentralization literature and to comprehensively analyze the decentralization of blockchain systems, we further elaborate on the three layers of infrastructure, incentive, and application that consolidate the layers used in the blockchain modeling and security literature. 

3 layers

1. Infrastructure: The infrastructure layer consists of data, network, and consensus layers that include the collection of data into blocks, the communication model (distributed networking, data forwarding, and verification), and the consensus mechanism (e.g. PoW, DPoS).
2. Incentive: The incentive layer consists of economic rewards to the blockchain system, including incentive mechanisms of the block creation process and token/asset distribution.
3. Application: The application layer consists of contract and application layers that include smart contracts, algorithms, and mechanisms that are used to facilitate high-level applications built on top of the blockchain system and all blockchain use cases, such as DeFi.

- Consensus and network decentralization are connected to the infrastructure layer.
- Wealth decentralization is connected to the incentive layer.
- Governance and transaction decentralization are connected to the application layer.

1. Consensus Decentralization:

- a state where all the entities or nodes of a blockchain system maintain the same distributed ledger. Decentralization of consensus is crucial to the security of a blockchain system.
- the “evenness” in the distribution of “mining power” in proof of work (PoW) permissionless blockchains.
- the distribution in voting delegation power (the power to delegate creators of blocks) for delegated proof of stake (DPoS) blockchains.
- the decentralization in the participation of consensus processes, such as mining in PoW protocols and staking or voting in proof of stake (PoS)
protocols.

Metrics to measure consensus decentralization: Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy, and the Nakamoto coefficient. And game theory to model consensus participation and equilibrium methods.
 
2. Network Decentralization:

- Fragmentation of control over the network, manifested in the security and fairness of a network system.
- Depicts decentralization in the underlying blockchain peerto-peer network infrastructure, such as how users communicate with the network and how nodes communicate with each other.

# DecentralizationIndex
Blockchains by Number of Nodes / Validators.

My notes from SoK: Blockchain Decentralization (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04256.pdf)

1. Protocol-based:
- Consensus & Network
- Governance
2. User-based:
- Wealth
- Transaction

1. Wallet user growth, 
2. Active address growth, 
3. Transaction count
4. Growth, and payment count growth

are strongly associated with returns.
